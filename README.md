# AFTER HOURS IA :shipit:
Our first group project! Julia, Dale, Ben built a helper tool for students - get help from your favourite IA, even when they are not around! Or if you simply need a nice little uplifting compliment, we have you covered.

**How to use the app:**
1. If you haven't signed up yet you'll only be able to generate an uplifting copmpliment if you are feeling down.
1. If you wanna ask a question to one of the IAs then sign up to the app!
2. After you sign up you can log in, and go to the page "Ask IA" to ask your question to anyone or to an IA of your choice.
3. A random quote from the IA(s) will be generated as an answer to your question.
4. You can visit 'My Quotes' page to add a new quote, edit or delete the quotes that you've created.
5. You can also generate a random compliment in case you are feeling down.
